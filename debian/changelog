  * Merge from Ubuntu:
   - 10-fix_bitmap_conf_file patch: 25-ttf-arphic-uming-bitmaps.conf causes
     wrong glyph rendering on Intrepid. Fixed. Additionally add
     25-ttf-arphic-uming-nobitmaps.conf as embedded bitmaps are enabled by
     default in fontconfig now. However, these two files are only copied to
     /etc/fonts/conf.avail/ . The user needs to link them to /etc/fonts/conf.d/
     manually if (s)he desires. (LP: #272913)
   - Rebuild with lzma compression, Pre-Depends: dpkg (>= 1.13.25)

  * use cdbs to build package
  * remove Provides: ttf-arphic-bsmi00lp and ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp entries
  Copied from FONTLOG:
  * Bug fix: 45 Big5 PUA glyphs and 4 HKSCS PUA glyphs have not been assigned
    codepoints -- FIXED.
  * Bug fix: the bitmap glyphs got lost due to a fontforge bug. -- FIXED
  * resized all glyphs back to an em-size of 1024 like they were originally.
    This also fixed the bug, that the glyphs and lines were too high.
    The previous em-size was 2098, while it should have been 2048.
  * completely reworked all Latin based glyphs (thanks to Maurizio M. Gavioli)
  * changed the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic based glyphs back to Monospace
  * added 1553 glyphs and references
  * compile font as TrueType Collection (TTC):
    contains 4 font flavors (CN, HK, TW, TW MBE) which map to different glyph
    styles. Currently this is only a proof of concept with only 2 codepoints
    (U+4EE4 and U+9AA8) between CN, HK and TW flavors and 13 different glyphs
    between the TW and TW MBE flavors. All other glyphs are exactly the same
    in all flavors.
  * debugged a lot of glyphs which had intersecting splines.
  * moved all glyphs from the PUA areas into unencoded space and only map
    those to the BMP PUA where it's necessary for roundtrip compatibility
    (i.e. the HKSCS PUA references only appear in the HK flavor, Big5
    references in HK, TW and TW MBE, and the GB18030-2000 references in the
    CN flavor.
  * added all outstanding PUA references for HKSCS to be compatible back to
    HKSCS in ISO 10646-1:1993
  * Name change: from AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni (MBE) to
    AR PL UMing {CN|HK|TW|TW MBE}.
    For backwards compatibility alias entries are defined to map
    "AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni" to "AR PL UMing HK" and "AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni MBE"
    to "AR PL UMing TW MBE".
  * split the fontconfig configuration file into 6 (LP: #175972) (Closes:
    #457420, #457417) :
    * 25-ttf-arphic-uming-render: fixes globaladvance and sets the font to be
      dual-width
    * 25-ttf-arphic-uming-bitmaps: enables embedded bitmaps
    * 35-ttf-arphic-uming-aliases: alias entries for
      "AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni (MBE)"
    * 41-ttf-arphic-uming.conf: binds font to Serif, Sans and Monospace
    * 64-ttf-arphic-uming.conf: alias settings for Serif, Sans and Monospace
      (Closes: #425024)
    * 90-ttf-arphic-uming-embolden.conf: emboldens the font
  * Changed the font information to advertise itself as "Light" style. (LP:
    #57578)
